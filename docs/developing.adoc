= Developing Applications With Apache Kudu

Kudu provides C++ and Java client APIs, as well as reference examples to illustrate
their use. A Python API is included, but it is currently considered experimental,
unstable, and subject to change at any time.

WARNING: Use of server-side or private interfaces is not supported, and interfaces
which are not part of public APIs have no stability guarantees.

== Viewing the API Documentation
include::installation.adoc[tags=view_api]

== Working Examples

Several example applications are provided in the
link:https://github.com/cloudera/kudu-examples[kudu-examples] Github
repository. Each example includes a `README` that shows how to compile and run
it. These examples illustrate correct usage of the Kudu APIs, as well as how to
set up a virtual machine to run Kudu. The following list includes some of the
examples that are available today. Check the repository itself in case this list goes
out of date.

`java-example`::
  A simple Java application which connects to a Kudu instance, creates a table, writes data to it, then drops the table.
`collectl`::
  A small Java application which listens on a TCP socket for time series data corresponding to the Collectl wire protocol.
  The commonly-available collectl tool can be used to send example data to the server.
`clients/python`::
  An experimental Python client for Kudu.
`demo-vm-setup`::
  Scripts to download and run a VirtualBox virtual machine with Kudu already installed.
  See link:quickstart.html[Quickstart] for more information.

These examples should serve as helpful starting points for your own Kudu applications and integrations.

=== Maven Artifacts
The following Maven `<dependency>` element is valid for the Kudu public beta:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.kudu</groupId>
  <artifactId>kudu-client</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Because the Maven artifacts are not in Maven Central, use the following `<repository>`
element:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
  <id>cdh.repo</id>
  <name>Cloudera Repositories</name>
  <url>https://repository.cloudera.com/artifactory/cloudera-repos</url>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>false</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository>
----

See subdirectories of https://github.com/cloudera/kudu-examples/tree/master/java for
example Maven pom.xml files.

== Example Impala Commands With Kudu

See link:kudu_impala_integration.html[Using Impala With Kudu] for guidance on installing
and using Impala with Kudu, including several `impala-shell` examples.

== Kudu Integration with Spark

Kudu integrates with Spark through the Data Source API as of version 0.9.
Include the kudu-spark jar using the --jars option:
[source]
----
spark-shell --jars kudu-spark-0.9.0.jar
----
then import kudu-spark and create a dataframe:
[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.kudu.spark.kudu._

// Read a table from Kudu
val df = sqlContext.read.options(Map("kudu.master" -> "kudu.master:7051","kudu.table" -> "kudu_table")).kudu

// Query using the Spark API...
df.select("id").filter("id" >= 5).show()

// ...or register a temporary table and use SQL
df.registerTempTable("kudu_table")
val filteredDF = sqlContext.sql("select id from kudu_table where id >= 5").show()

// Use KuduContext to create, delete, or write to Kudu tables
val kuduContext = new KuduContext("kudu.master:7051")

// Create a new Kudu table from a dataframe schema
// NB: No rows from the dataframe are inserted into the table
kuduContext.createTable("test_table", df.schema, Seq("key"), new CreateTableOptions().setNumReplicas(1))

// Insert data
kuduContext.insertRows(df, "test_table")

// Delete data
kuduContext.deleteRows(filteredDF, "test_table")

// Upsert data
kuduContext.upsertRows(df, "test_table")

// Update data
val alteredDF = df.select("id", $"count" + 1)
kuduContext.updateRows(filteredRows, "test_table"

// Data can also be inserted into the Kudu table using the data source, though the methods on KuduContext are preferred
// NB: The default is to upsert rows; to perform standard inserts instead, set operation = insert in the options map
// NB: Only mode Append is supported
df.write.options(Map("kudu.master"-> "kudu.master:7051", "kudu.table"-> "test_table")).mode("append").kudu

// Check for the existence of a Kudu table
kuduContext.tableExists("another_table")

// Delete a Kudu table
kuduContext.deleteTable("unwanted_table")
----

== Integration with MapReduce, YARN, and Other Frameworks

Kudu was designed to integrate with MapReduce, YARN, Spark, and other frameworks in
the Hadoop ecosystem. See
link:https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/master/java/kudu-client-tools/src/main/java/org/apache/kudu/mapreduce/tools/RowCounter.java[RowCounter.java]
and
link:https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/master/java/kudu-client-tools/src/main/java/org/apache/kudu/mapreduce/tools/ImportCsv.java[ImportCsv.java]
for examples which you can model your own integrations on. Stay tuned for more examples
using YARN and Spark in the future.
