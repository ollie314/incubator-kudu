[[rn_0.10.0]]
== Release notes specific to 0.10.0

Kudu 0.10.0 delivers a number of new features, bug fixes, and optimizations,
detailed below.

Kudu 0.10.0 maintains wire-compatibility with previous releases, meaning
that applications using the Kudu client libraries may be upgraded either
before, at the same time, or after the Kudu servers. However, if you begin
using new features of Kudu 0.10.0 such as manually range-partitioned tables,
you must first upgrade all clients to this release.

This release does not maintain full Java API or ABI compatibility with
Kudu 0.9.x due to a package rename and some other small changes. See below for details.

for Kudu 0.10.0</a>+++ and +++<a href="https://github.com/apache/kudu/compare/0.9.1...0.10.0">Git
changes between 0.9.1 and 0.10.0</a>+++.

To upgrade to Kudu 0.10.0, see <<rn_0.10.0_upgrade>>.

[[rn_0.10.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes and deprecated APIs in 0.10.0

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3737[Gerrit #3737] The Java client has been repackaged
  under `org.apache.kudu` instead of `org.kududb`. Import statements for Kudu classes must
  be modified in order to compile against 0.10.0. Wire compatibility is maintained.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3055/[Gerrit #3055] The Java client's
  synchronous API methods now throw `KuduException` instead of `Exception`.
  Existing code that catches `Exception` should still compile, but introspection of an
  exception's message may be impacted. This change was made to allow thrown exceptions to be
  queried more easily using `KuduException.getStatus` and calling one of `Status`'s methods.
  For example, an operation that tries to delete a table that doesn't exist would return a
  `Status` that returns true when queried on `isNotFound()`.

- The Java client's `KuduTable.getTabletsLocations` set of methods is now
  deprecated. Additionally, they now take an exclusive end partition key instead
  of an inclusive key. Applications are encouraged to use the scan tokens API
  instead of these methods in the future.

- The C++ API for specifying split points on range-partitioned tables has been improved
  to make it easier for callers to properly manage the ownership of the provided rows.
+
The `TableCreator::split_rows` API took a `vector<const KuduPartialRow*>`, which
  made it very difficult for the calling application to do proper error handling with
  cleanup when setting the fields of the `KuduPartialRow`. This API has been now been
  deprecated and replaced by a new method `TableCreator::add_range_split` which allows
  easier use of smart pointers for safe memory management.

- The Java client's internal buffering has been reworked. Previously, the number of
  buffered write operations was constrained on a per-tablet-server basis. Now, the configured
  maximum buffer size constrains the total number of buffered operations across all
  tablet servers in the cluster. This provides a more consistent bound on the memory
  usage of the client regardless of the size of the cluster to which it is writing.
+
This change can negatively affect the write performance of Java clients which rely on
  buffered writes. Consider using the `setMutationBufferSpace` API to increase a
  session's maximum buffer size if write performance seems to be degraded after upgrading
  to Kudu 0.10.0.

- The "remote bootstrap" process used to copy a tablet replica from one host to
  another has been renamed to "Tablet Copy". This resulted in the renaming of
  several RPC metrics. Any users previously explicitly fetching or monitoring metrics
  related to Remote Bootstrap should update their scripts to reflect the new names.

- The SparkSQL datasource for Kudu no longer supports mode `Overwrite`. Users should
  use the new `KuduContext.upsertRows` method instead. Additionally, inserts using the
  datasource are now upserts by default. The older behavior can be restored by setting
  the `operation` parameter to `insert`.

[[rn_0.10.0_new_features]]
=== New features

- Users may now manually manage the partitioning of a range-partitioned table.
  When a table is created, the user may specify a set of range partitions that
  do not cover the entire available key space. A user may add or drop range
  partitions to existing tables.
+
This feature can be particularly helpful with time series workloads in which
  new partitions can be created on an hourly or daily basis. Old partitions
  may be efficiently dropped if the application does not need to retain historical
  data past a certain point.
+
This feature is considered experimental for the 0.10 release. More details of
  the new feature can be found in the accompanying
  link:https://kudu.apache.org/2016/08/23/new-range-partitioning-features.html[blog post].

- Support for running Kudu clusters with multiple masters has been stabilized.
  Users may start a cluster with three or five masters to provide fault tolerance
  despite a failure of one or two masters, respectively.
+
Note that certain tools (e.g. `ksck`) are still lacking complete support for
  multiple masters. These deficiencies will be addressed in a following release.

- Kudu now supports the ability to reserve a certain amount of free disk space
  in each of its configured data directories. If a directory's free disk space
  drops to less than the configured minimum, Kudu will stop writing to that
  directory until space becomes available. If no space is available in any
  configured directory, Kudu will abort.
+
This feature may be configured using the `fs_data_dirs_reserved_bytes` and
  `fs_wal_dir_reserved_bytes` flags.

- The Spark integration's `KuduContext` now supports four new methods for writing to
  Kudu tables: `insertRows`, `upsertRows`, `updateRows`, and `deleteRows`. These are
  now the preferred way to write to Kudu tables from Spark.

[[rn_0.10.0_improvements]]
=== Improvements and optimizations

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1516[KUDU-1516] The `kudu-ksck` tool
  has been improved and now detects problems such as when a tablet does not have
  a majority of replicas on live tablet servers, or if those replicas arenâ€™t in a
  good state. Users who currently depend on the tool to detect inconsistencies may now see
  failures when before they wouldn't see any.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/3477[Gerrit #3477] The way operations are buffered in
  the Java client has been reworked. Previously, the session's buffer size was set per tablet, meaning that a buffer
  size of 1,000 for 10 tablets being written to allowed for 10,000 operations to be buffered at the
  same time. With this change, all the tablets share one buffer, so users might need to set a
  bigger buffer size in order to reach the same level of performance as before.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3674/[Gerrit #3674] Added LESS and GREATER options for
  column predicates.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1444[KUDU-1444] added support for passing
  back basic per-scan metrics (e.g cache hit rate) from the server to the C++ client. See the
  `KuduScanner::GetResourceMetrics()` API for detailed usage. This feature will be supported
  in the Java client API in a future release.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1446[KUDU-1446] improved the order in
  which the tablet server evaluates predicates, so that predicates on smaller columns
  are evaluated first. This may improve performance on queries which apply predicates
  on multiple columns of different sizes.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1398[KUDU-1398] improved the storage
  efficiency of Kudu's internal primary key indexes. This optimization should decrease space
  usage and improve random access performance, particularly for workloads with lengthy
  primary keys.

[[rn_0.10.0_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3541/[Gerrit #3541] Fixed a problem in the Java client
  whereby an RPC could be dropped when a connection to a tablet server or master was forcefully
  closed on the server-side while RPCs to that server were in the process of being encoded.
  The effect was that the RPC would not be sent, and users of the synchronous API would receive
  a `TimeoutException`. Several other Java client bugs which could cause similar spurious timeouts
  were also fixed in this release.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3724/[Gerrit #3724] Fixed a problem in the Java client
  whereby an RPC could be dropped when a socket timeout was fired while that RPC was being sent to
  a tablet server or master. This would manifest itself in the same way
  link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3541/[Gerrit #3541].

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1538[KUDU-1538] fixed a bug in which recycled
  block identifiers could cause the tablet server to lose data. Following this bug fix, block
  identifiers will no longer be reused.

[[rn_0.10.0_changes]]
=== Other noteworthy changes

- This is the first release of Apache Kudu as a top-level (non-incubating)
  project!

- The default false positive rate for Bloom filters has been changed
  from 1% to 0.01%. This will increase the space consumption of Bloom
  filters by a factor of two (from approximately 10 bits per row to
  approximately 20 bits per row). This is expected to substantially
  improve the performance of random-write workloads at the cost of an
  incremental increase in disk space usage.

- The Kudu C++ client library now has Doxygen-based
  link:http://kudu.apache.org/cpp-client-api/[API documentation]
  available online.

- Kudu now
  link:http://kudu.apache.org/2016/06/17/raft-consensus-single-node.html[
  uses the Raft consensus algorithm even for unreplicated tables].
  This change simplifies code and will also allow administrators to enable
  replication on a previously-unreplicated table. This change is internal and
  should not be visible to users.

[[rn_0.10.0_upgrade]]
=== Upgrading from 0.9.x to 0.10.0

Before upgrading, see <<rn_0.10.0_incompatible_changes>> and

[[rn_0.9.1_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1469[KUDU-1469] fixed a bug in
our Raft consensus implementation that could cause a tablet to stop making progress after a leader
election.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3456/[Gerrit #3456] fixed a bug in which
servers under high load could store metric information in incorrect memory
locations, causing crashes or data corruption.

- link:https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3457/[Gerrit #3457] fixed a bug in which
errors from the Java client would carry an incorrect error message.

- Several other small bug fixes were backported to improve stability.

[[rn_0.9.0]]
== Release notes specific to 0.9.0

Kudu 0.9.0 delivers incremental features, improvements, and bug fixes over the previous versions.

See also +++<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20KUDU%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved

changes between 0.8.0 and 0.9.0</a>+++.

To upgrade to Kudu 0.10.0, see <<rn_0.9.0_upgrade>>.

[[rn_0.9.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes

- The `KuduTableInputFormat` command has changed the way in which it handles
  scan predicates, including how it serializes predicates to the job configuration
  object. The new configuration key is `kudu.mapreduce.encoded.predicate`. Clients
  using the `TableInputFormatConfigurator` are not affected.

- The `kudu-spark` sub-project has been renamed to follow naming conventions for
  Scala. The new name is `kudu-spark_2.10`.

- Default table partitioning has been removed. All tables must now be created
  with explicit partitioning. Existing tables are unaffected. See the
  link:schema_design.html#no_default_partitioning[schema design guide] for more
  details.

[[rn_0.9.0_new_features]]
=== New features
- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1002[KUDU-1002] Added support for
 `UPSERT` operations, whereby a row is inserted if it does not already exist, but
 updated if it does. Support for `UPSERT` is included in Java, C++, and Python APIs,
 but not in Impala.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1306[KUDU-1306] Scan token API
  for creating partition-aware scan descriptors. This API simplifies executing
  parallel scans for clients and query engines.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2848/[Gerrit 2848] Added a kudu datasource
  for Spark. This datasource uses the Kudu client directly instead of
  using the MapReduce API. Predicate pushdowns for `spark-sql` and Spark filters are
  included, as well as parallel retrieval for multiple tablets and column projections.
  See an example of link:developing.html#_kudu_integration_with_spark[Kudu integration with Spark].

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2992/[Gerrit 2992] Added the ability
  to update and insert from Spark using a Kudu datasource.

[[rn_0.9.0_improvements]]
=== Improvements

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1415[KUDU-1415] Added statistics in the Java
  client such as the number of bytes written and the number of operations applied.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1451[KUDU-1451] Improved tablet server restart
  time when the tablet server needs to clean up of a lot previously deleted tablets. Tablets are
  now cleaned up after they are deleted.

[[rn_0.9.0_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-678[KUDU-678] Fixed a leak that happened during
  DiskRowSet compactions where tiny blocks were still written to disk even if there were no REDO
  records. With the default block manager, it usually resulted in block containers with thousands
  of tiny blocks.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1437[KUDU-1437] Fixed a data corruption issue
  that occured after compacting sequences of negative INT32 values in a column that
  was configured with RLE encoding.

[[rn_0.9.0_changes]]
=== Other noteworthy changes

All Kudu clients have longer default timeout values, as listed below.

.Java
- The default operation timeout and the default admin operation timeout
  are now set to 30 seconds instead of 10.
- The default socket read timeout is now 10 seconds instead of 5.

.C++
- The default admin timeout is now 30 seconds instead of 10.
- The default RPC timeout is now 10 seconds instead of 5.
- The default scan timeout is now 30 seconds instead of 15.

- Some default settings related to I/O behavior during flushes and compactions have been changed:
  The default for `flush_threshold_mb` has been increased from 64MB to 1000MB. The default
  `cfile_do_on_finish` has been changed from `close` to `flush`.
  link:http://getkudu.io/2016/04/26/ycsb.html[Experiments using YCSB] indicate that these
  values will provide better throughput for write-heavy applications on typical server hardware.

[[rn_0.9.0_upgrade]]
=== Upgrading from 0.8.0 to 0.9.x

Before upgrading, see <<rn_0.9.0_incompatible_changes>> and
<<rn_0.9.0_client_compatibility>>. To upgrade from Kudu 0.8.0 to 0.9.0, perform
the following high-level steps, which are detailed in the installation guide
under link:installation.html#upgrade_procedure[Upgrade Procedure]:

. Shut down all Kudu services.
. Install the new Kudu packages or parcels, or install Kudu 0.9.1 from source.
. Restart all Kudu services.

It is technically possible to upgrade Kudu using rolling restarts, but it has not
been tested and is not recommended.

NOTE: For the duration of the Kudu Beta, upgrade instructions are only given for going
from the previous latest version to the newest.

[[rn_0.9.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client compatibility

Masters and tablet servers should be upgraded before clients are upgraded. For specific
information about client compatibility, see the <<rn_0.9.0_incompatible_changes>> section.


[[rn_0.8.0]]
== Release notes specific to 0.8.0

Kudu 0.8.0 delivers incremental features, improvements, and bug fixes over the previous versions.

See also +++<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20KUDU%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved

for Kudu 0.8.0</a>+++ and +++<a href="https://github.com/apache/kudu/compare/0.7.1...0.8.0">Git
changes between 0.7.1 and 0.8.0</a>+++.

To upgrade to Kudu 0.8.0, see link:installation.html#upgrade[Upgrade from 0.7.1 to 0.8.0].

[[rn_0.8.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes

- 0.8.0 clients are not fully compatible with servers running Kudu 0.7.1 or lower.
In particular, scans that specify column predicates will fail. To work around this
issue, upgrade all Kudu servers before upgrading clients.

[[rn_0.8.0_new_features]]
=== New features

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-431[KUDU-431] A simple Flume
  sink has been implemented.

[[rn_0.8.0_improvements]]
=== Improvements

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-839[KUDU-839] Java RowError now uses an enum error code.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2138/[Gerrit 2138] The handling of
  column predicates has been re-implemented in the server and clients.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1379[KUDU-1379] Partition pruning
  has been implemented for C++ clients (but not yet for the Java client). This feature
  allows you to avoid reading a tablet if you know it does not serve the row keys you are querying.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2641[Gerrit 2641] Kudu now uses
  `earliest-deadline-first` RPC scheduling and rejection. This changes the behavior
  of the RPC service queue to prevent unfairness when processing a backlog of RPC
  threads and to increase the likelihood that an RPC will be processed before it
  can time out.


[[rn_0.8.0_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- link:https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1337[KUDU-1337] Tablets from tables
  that were deleted might be unnecessarily re-bootstrapped when the leader gets the
  notification to delete itself after the replicas do.

- link:https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-969[KUDU-969] If a tablet server
  shuts down while compacting a rowset and receiving updates for it, it might immediately
  crash upon restart while bootstrapping that rowset's tablet.

- link:https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1354[KUDU-1354] Due to a bug in Kudu's
  MVCC implementation where row locks were released before the MVCC commit happened,
  flushed data would include out-of-order transactions, triggering a crash on the
  next compaction.

- link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1322[KUDU-1322] The C++ client
  now retries write operations if the tablet it is trying to reach has already been
  deleted.

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2571/[Gerrit 2571] Due to a bug in the
  Java client, users were unable to close the `kudu-spark` shell because of
  lingering non-daemon threads.

[[rn_0.8.0_changes]]
=== Other noteworthy changes

- link:http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/2239/[Gerrit 2239] The concept of "feature flags"
  was introduced in order to manage compatibility between different
  Kudu versions. One case where this is helpful is if a newer client attempts to use
  a feature unsupported by the currently-running tablet server. Rather than receiving
  a cryptic error, the user gets an error message that is easier to interpret.
  This is an internal change for Kudu system developers and requires no action by
  users of the clients or API.

[[rn_0.7.1]]
== Release notes specific to 0.7.1

Kudu 0.7.1 is a bug fix release for 0.7.0.

[[rn_0.7.1_fixed_issues]]

=== Fixed Issues

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1325[KUDU-1325] fixes a tablet server crash that could
occur during table deletion. In some cases, while a table was being deleted, other replicas would
attempt to re-replicate tablets to servers that had already processed the deletion. This could
trigger a race condition that caused a crash.

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1341[KUDU-1341] fixes a potential data corruption and
crash that could happen shortly after tablet server restarts in workloads that repeatedly delete
and re-insert rows with the same primary key. In most cases, this corruption affected only a single
replica and could be repaired by re-replicating from another.

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1343[KUDU-1343] fixes a bug in the Java client that
occurs when a scanner has to scan multiple batches from one tablet and then start scanning from
another. In particular, this would affect any scans using the Java client that read large numbers
of rows from multi-tablet tables.

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1345[KUDU-1345] fixes a bug where in some cases the
hybrid clock could jump backwards, resulting in a crash followed by an inability to
restart the affected tablet server.

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1360[KUDU-1360] fixes a bug in the kudu-spark module
which prevented reading rows with `NULL` values.

[[rn_0.7.0]]
== Release notes specific to 0.7.0

Kudu 0.7.0 is the first release done as part of the Apache Incubator and includes a number
of changes, new features, improvements, and fixes.

changes between 0.6.0 and 0.7.0</a>+++.

The upgrade instructions can be found at link:installation.html#upgrade[Upgrade from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0].

[[rn_0.7.0_incompatible_changes]]
=== Incompatible changes

- The C++ client includes a new API, `KuduScanBatch`, which performs better when a
large number of small rows are returned in a batch. The old API of `vector<KuduRowResult>`
is deprecated.
+
NOTE: This change is API-compatible but *not* ABI-compatible.

- The default replication factor has been changed from 1 to 3. Existing tables will
continue to use the replication factor they were created with. Applications that create
tables may not work properly if they assume a replication factor of 1 and fewer than
3 replicas are available. To use the previous default replication factor, start the
master with the configuration flag `--default_num_replicas=1`.

- The Python client has been completely rewritten, with a focus on improving code
quality and testing. The read path (scanners) has been improved by adding many of
the features already supported by the C++ and Java clients. The Python client is no
longer considered experimental.

[[rn_0.7.0_new_features]]
=== New features

- With the goal of Spark integration in mind, a new `kuduRDD` API has been added,
which wraps `newAPIHadoopRDD` and includes a default source for Spark SQL.

[[rn_0.7.0_improvements]]
=== Improvements

- The Java client includes new methods `countPendingErrors()` and
`getPendingErrors()` on `KuduSession`. These methods allow you to count and
retrieve outstanding row errors when configuring sessions with `AUTO_FLUSH_BACKGROUND`.

- New server-level metrics allow you to monitor CPU usage and context switching.

- Kudu now builds on RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SLES 12. Extra instructions are included
for SLES 12.


[[rn_0.7.0_fixed_issues]]
=== Fixed Issues

- https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1288[KUDU-1288] fixes a severe file descriptor
leak, which could previously only be resolved by restarting the tablet server.

- https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/KUDU-1250[KUDU-1250] fixes a hang in the Java
client when processing an in-flight batch and the previous batch encountered an error.

[[rn_0.7.0_changes]]
=== Other noteworthy changes

- The file block manager's performance was improved, but it is still not recommended for
real-world use.

- The master now attempts to spread tablets more evenly across the cluster during
table creation. This has no impact on existing tables, but will improve the speed
at which under-replicated tabletsare re-replicated after a tablet server failure.

- All licensing documents have been modified to adhere to ASF guidelines.

- Kudu now requires an out-of-tree build directory. Review the build instructions
for additional information.

- The `C++` client library is now explicitly built against the
link:https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html[old gcc5 ABI].
If you use gcc5 to build a Kudu application, your application must use the old ABI
as well. This is typically achieved by defining the `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI` macro
at compile-time when building your application. For more information, see the
previous link and link:http://developerblog.redhat.com/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/.

- The Python client is no longer considered experimental.

=== Limitations

See also <<beta_limitations>>. Where applicable, this list adds to or overrides that
list.

==== Operating System Limitations
* Kudu 0.7 is known to work on RHEL 7 or 6.4 or newer, CentOS 7 or 6.4 or newer, Ubuntu
Trusty, and SLES 12. Other operating systems may work but have not been tested.


[[rn_0.6.0]]
== Release notes specific to 0.6.0

The 0.6.0 release contains incremental improvements and bug fixes. The most notable
changes are:

- The Java client's CreateTableBuilder and AlterTableBuilder classes have been renamed
to CreateTableOptions and AlterTableOptions. Their methods now also return `this` objects,
allowing them to be used as builders.
- The Java client's AbstractKuduScannerBuilder#maxNumBytes() setter is now called
batchSizeBytes as is the corresponding property in AsyncKuduScanner. This makes it
consistent with the C++ client.
- The "kudu-admin" tool can now list and delete tables via its new subcommands
"list_tables" and "delete_table <table_name>".
- OSX is now supported for single-host development. Please consult its specific installation
instructions in link:installation.html#osx_from_source[OS X].

== About the Kudu Public Beta

Releases of Apache Kudu prior to 1.0 are considered beta. Do not run beta releases on production clusters.
During the public beta period, Kudu will be supported via a
link:https://issues.cloudera.org/projects/KUDU[public JIRA] and a public
link:http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/kudu-user/[mailing list], which will be
monitored by the Kudu development team and community members. Commercial support
is not available at this time.

* You can submit any issues or feedback related to your Kudu experience via either
the JIRA system or the mailing list. The Kudu development team and community members
will respond and assist as quickly as possible.
* The Kudu team will work with early adopters to fix bugs and release new binary drops
when fixes or features are ready. However, we cannot commit to issue resolution or
bug fix delivery times during the public beta period, and it is possible that some
fixes or enhancements will not be selected for a release.
* We can't guarantee time frames or contents for future beta code drops. However,
they will be announced to the user group when they occur.
* No guarantees are made regarding upgrades from this release to follow-on releases.
While multiple drops of beta code are planned, we can't guarantee their schedules
or contents.


[[beta_limitations]]
=== Limitations of the Kudu Public Beta

Items in this list may be amended or superseded by limitations listed in the release
notes for specific Kudu releases above.


==== Schema Limitations
* Kudu is primarily designed for analytic use cases and, in the beta release,
you are likely to encounter issues if a single row contains multiple kilobytes of data.
* The columns which make up the primary key must be listed first in the schema.
* Key columns cannot be altered. You must drop and recreate a table to change its keys.
* Key columns must not be null.
* Columns with `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT`, or `BOOL` types are not allowed as part of a
primary key definition.
* Type and nullability of existing columns cannot be changed by altering the table.
* A tableâ€™s primary key cannot be changed.
* Dropping a column does not immediately reclaim space. Compaction must run first.
There is no way to run compaction manually, but dropping the table will reclaim the
space immediately.

==== Ingest Limitations
* Ingest via Sqoop or Flume is not supported in the public beta. The recommended
approach for bulk ingest is to use Impalaâ€™s `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` functionality
or use the Kudu Java or C++ API.
* Tables must be manually pre-split into tablets using simple or compound primary
keys. Automatic splitting is not yet possible. See
link:schema_design.html[Schema Design].
* Tablets cannot currently be merged. Instead, create a new table with the contents
of the old tables to be merged.

==== Replication and Backup Limitations
* Replication and failover of Kudu masters is considered experimental. It is
recommended to run a single master and periodically perform a manual backup of
its data directories.

==== Impala Limitations
* To use Kudu with Impala, you must install a special release of Impala called
Impala_Kudu. Obtaining and installing a compatible Impala release is detailed in Kudu's
link:kudu_impala_integration.html[Impala Integration] documentation.
* To use Impala_Kudu alongside an existing Impala instance, you must install using parcels.
* Updates, inserts, and deletes via Impala are non-transactional. If a query
fails part of the way through, its partial effects will not be rolled back.
* All queries will be distributed across all Impala hosts which host a replica
of the target table(s), even if a predicate on a primary key could correctly
restrict the query to a single tablet. This limits the maximum concurrency of
short queries made via Impala.
* No timestamp and decimal type support.
* The maximum parallelism of a single query is limited to the number of tablets
in a table. For good analytic performance, aim for 10 or more tablets per host
or use large tables.
* Impala is only able to push down predicates involving `=`, `<=`, `>=`,
or `BETWEEN` comparisons between any column and a literal value, and `<` and `>`
for integer columns only. For example, for a table with an integer key `ts`, and
a string key `name`, the predicate `WHERE ts >= 12345` will convert into an
efficient range scan, whereas `where name > 'lipcon'` will currently fetch all
data from the table and evaluate the predicate within Impala.

==== Security Limitations

* Authentication and authorization are not included in the public beta.
* Data encryption is not included in the public beta.

==== Client and API Limitations

* Potentially-incompatible C++, Java and Python API changes may be required during the
public beta.
* `ALTER TABLE` is not yet fully supported via the client APIs. More `ALTER TABLE`
operations will become available in future betas.

==== Application Integration Limitations

* The Spark DataFrame implementation is not yet complete.

==== Other Known Issues

The following are known bugs and issues with the current release of Kudu. They will
be addressed in later beta releases.

* If the Kudu master is configured with the `-log_fsync_all` option, tablet servers
and clients will experience frequent timeouts, and the cluster may become unusable.

* If a tablet server has a very large number of tablets, it may take several minutes
to start up. It is recommended to limit the number of tablets per server to 100 or fewer.
Consider this limitation when pre-splitting your tables. If you notice slow start-up times,
you can monitor the number of tablets per server in the web UI.
