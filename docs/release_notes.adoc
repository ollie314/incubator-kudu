[[rn_1.1.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible changes in Kudu 1.1.0

=== Client APIs ({cpp}/Java/Python)

- The {cpp} client library no longer requires the
  link:https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html[old gcc5 ABI].
  Which ABI is actually used depends on the compiler configuration. Some new distros
  (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04) will use the new ABI. Your application must use the same ABI as is
  used by the client library; an easy way to guarantee this is to use the same compiler
  to build both.

- The Java client's `OperationResponse.getWriteTimestamp` method was renamed to `getWriteTimestampRaw`
  to emphasize that it doesn't return milliseconds, unlike what its Javadoc indicated. The renamed
  method was also hidden from the public APIs and should not be used.

[[known_issues_and_limitations]]
== Known Issues and Limitations

=== Schema and Usage Limitations
* Kudu is primarily designed for analytic use cases. You are likely to encounter issues if
  a single row contains multiple kilobytes of data.

* The columns which make up the primary key must be listed first in the schema.

* Key columns cannot be altered. You must drop and recreate a table to change its keys.

* Key columns must not be null.

* Columns with `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT`, or `BOOL` types are not allowed as part of a
  primary key definition.

* Type and nullability of existing columns cannot be changed by altering the table.

* A tableâ€™s primary key cannot be changed.

* Dropping a column does not immediately reclaim space. Compaction must run first.
There is no way to run compaction manually, but dropping the table will reclaim the
space immediately.

=== Partitioning Limitations
* Tables must be manually pre-split into tablets using simple or compound primary
  keys. Automatic splitting is not yet possible. Range partitions may be added
  or dropped after a table has been created. See
  link:schema_design.html[Schema Design] for more information.

* Data in existing tables cannot currently be automatically repartitioned. As a workaround,
  create a new table with the new partitioning and insert the contents of the old
  table.

=== Replication and Backup Limitations
* Kudu does not currently include any built-in features for backup and restore.
  Users are encouraged to use tools such as Spark or Impala to export or import
  tables as necessary.

=== Impala Limitations

* To use Kudu with Impala, you must install a special release of Impala called
  Impala_Kudu. Obtaining and installing a compatible Impala release is detailed in Kudu's
  link:kudu_impala_integration.html[Impala Integration] documentation.

* To use Impala_Kudu alongside an existing Impala instance, you must install using parcels.

* Updates, inserts, and deletes via Impala are non-transactional. If a query
  fails part of the way through, its partial effects will not be rolled back.

* All queries will be distributed across all Impala hosts which host a replica
  of the target table(s), even if a predicate on a primary key could correctly
  restrict the query to a single tablet. This limits the maximum concurrency of
  short queries made via Impala.

* No timestamp and decimal type support.

* The maximum parallelism of a single query is limited to the number of tablets
  in a table. For good analytic performance, aim for 10 or more tablets per host
  or use large tables.

* Impala is only able to push down predicates involving `=`, `<=`, `>=`,
  or `BETWEEN` comparisons between any column and a literal value, and `<` and `>`
  for integer columns only. For example, for a table with an integer key `ts`, and
  a string key `name`, the predicate `WHERE ts >= 12345` will convert into an
  efficient range scan, whereas `where name > 'lipcon'` will currently fetch all
  data from the table and evaluate the predicate within Impala.

=== Security Limitations

* Authentication and authorization features are not implemented.
* Data encryption is not built in. Kudu has been reported to run correctly
  on systems using local block device encryption (e.g. `dmcrypt`).

=== Client and API Limitations

* `ALTER TABLE` is not yet fully supported via the client APIs. More `ALTER TABLE`
  operations will become available in future releases.

=== Other Known Issues

The following are known bugs and issues with the current release of Kudu. They will
be addressed in later releases. Note that this list is not exhaustive, and is meant
to communicate only the most important known issues.

* If the Kudu master is configured with the `-log_fsync_all` option, tablet servers
  and clients will experience frequent timeouts, and the cluster may become unusable.

* If a tablet server has a very large number of tablets, it may take several minutes
  to start up. It is recommended to limit the number of tablets per server to 100 or fewer.
  Consider this limitation when pre-splitting your tables. If you notice slow start-up times,
  you can monitor the number of tablets per server in the web UI.

* Due to a known bug in Linux kernels prior to 3.8, running Kudu on `ext4` mount points
  may cause a subsequent `fsck` to fail with errors such as `Logical start <N> does
  not match logical start <M> at next level`. These errors are repairable using `fsck -y`,
  but may impact server restart time.
+
This affects RHEL/CentOS 6.8 and below. A fix is planned for RHEL/CentOS 6.9.
  RHEL 7.0 and higher are not affected. Ubuntu 14.04 and later are not affected.
  SLES 12 and later are not affected.
